# Bug-Tracker

I created and used this project to help keep track of issues.  This allowed me to keep tracks of bugs and fixes I needed to make on this project, and other projects without mixing up the issues.  

This project was something that I wanted to do for a while.  This project tested my abilites to connect the front-end to the backend.  I ran into many issues, but worked my way through them.  I used this project to imporove my NodeJS skills for the backend, and to work on getting a better grasp on MongoDB.

There are things I want to add to this project yet.

1) Add security to password strength.  Currently I don't have much of stipulations on the password.
2) Add more ways to sort, and do the sorting server side.
3) Possibly convert the front-end to React.
4) Also, just looking at ways to make the code better, and more efficient.

Getting this project wrapped up feels great, but like always, I have plans for what I want to do next.
